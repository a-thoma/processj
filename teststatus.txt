tests that pass (with some exceptions):

Hello.pj
alttest.pj (will livelock on writer2, expected)
barrierEx.pj
bartest.pj (fixed timer read issue and double-free issue)
binexpr.pj (no output but verified)
bytecode.pj (not necessary, no bytecode is modified because no bytecode is generated)
car.pj (fixed char* issue, alls strings are now std::strings)
channelWR.pj (fixed chan init issue)
commstime.pj (fixed problem with pars not reinitializing in a loop)
cpparraytest.pj (fixed problem with initializers)
cppiotest.pj
cpprecordtest.pj
cpptimerreadtest.pj
iftest.pj
protocols.pj
Demo2.pj
fortest.pj
NetworkProc.pj
parExp.pj
protocolSwitch.pj
readEx.pj
simple.pj (livelocks on read call, expected)
simplepj.pj
SwitchDemo.pj
timer.pj
verySimple.pj

tests that don't pass:
Demo.pj (problem with inheritance/structure)
Demo_matt.pj (issue with channel reads + a value)
enrolledtest.pj (multiple pars, need to add that functionality)
fullAdder.pj (colliding class overload names for invocation proc types)
integrate.pj (ask pedersen/ben about this one)
localDecl.pj (don't need this though, there's just no main)
mandelbrot.pj (needs pgm library)
mandelbrot2.pj (needs pgm library)
Matt.pj (channel reads + a value again)
santa.pj (probably lots of problems that will be fixed after the above are also fixed)
santatest.pj (protocols with no fields?)
sharedchan.pj (infinite loop issues?)
sharedread.pj (infinite loop issues?)
sharedwrite.pj (infinite loop issues?)
silly.pj (more channel read stuff)
test22.pj (probably template stuff)
