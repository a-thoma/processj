tests that pass (with some exceptions):

Hello.pj
alttest.pj (will livelock on writer2, expected)
barrierEx.pj
bartest.pj (fixed timer read issue and double-free issue)
binexpr.pj (no output but verified)
bytecode.pj (not necessary, no bytecode is modified because no bytecode is generated)
car.pj (fixed char* issue, alls strings are now std::strings)
channelWR.pj (fixed chan init issue)
commstime.pj (fixed problem with pars not reinitializing in a loop)
cpparraytest.pj (fixed problem with initializers)
cppiotest.pj
cpprecordtest.pj

fortest.pj
NetworkProc.pj
parExp.pj
protocols.pj
protocolSwitch.pj
readEx.pj

tests that don't pass:
Demo.pj (problem with inheritance/structure)

mandelbrot2.pj (needs pgm library)
Matt.pj (channel reads + a value again)
santa.pj (probably lots of problems that will be fixed after the above are also fixed)
santatest.pj (protocols with no fields?)
sharedchan.pj (infinite loop issues?)
sharedread.pj (infinite loop issues?)
