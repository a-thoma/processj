tests that pass:

Hello.pj
alttest.pj (will deadlock on writer2, expected)
barrierEx.pj
bartest.pj (t.read() is treated as a channel read expr?)
binexpr.pj (no output but verified)
bytecode.pj (not necessary, no bytecode is modified because no bytecode is generated)
car.pj (fixed char* issue, alls strings are now std::strings)
channelWR.pj (fixed chan init issue)
commstime.pj (fixed problem with pars not reinitializing in a loop)
